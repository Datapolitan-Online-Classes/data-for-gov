# What is Analysis?
--

> Analysis is simply the pursuit of understanding, usually through detailed inspection or comparison

## - [Carter Hewgley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carterhewgley)

# So How Do We Get There?

---

# Be Aware of This

> We need to use X tool because everyone is using it

---

> Data is only as valuable as the decisions it enables. 

## -[Ion Stoica](https://twitter.com/databricks/status/810190036624875520)

> Data tools are only as valuable as the outcomes they enable.

# The Data Analytics Tool Box

---

# Spreadsheets
--

+ Allow us to load, clean, format, transform, and visualize data
--

+ Usually easy to use for a general population of data users
--

+ Limited in functionality and size of data
--

+ Usually need to be purchased
--

+ [Though some are free](https://www.pcworld.com/article/218394/best-microsoft-office-alternatives.html)

---

# Programming Languages
--

+ Easily does basic data work
--

+ Also supports more advanced data work
--

+ Usually requires more specialized knowledge and training
--

+ Can do a variety of data tasks, even with very large data sets
--

+ Language and basic tools are usually free
--

+ Sometimes needs special hardware to run on large datasets

---

# Data Visualization/Mapping
--

+ A data story is best communicated visually
--

+ A good visualization will communicate key insights easily and without effort
